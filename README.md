We created a design that replicated the one given to us which was responsive on different screen sizes. We learned how to commit information into local storage, access that information, and then use it and change it on the screen. This allowed us to successfully append cards that had information stored in local storage and change them if the user wanted. Also, if the user deletes the card it is removed from the page, as well as, local storage. Lastly, we created a search function that searches for the letters or word the user is looking for and displays the cards that only contain the search input.
